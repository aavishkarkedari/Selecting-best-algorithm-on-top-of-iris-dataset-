# Selecting the Best Machine Learning Model for Iris Flower Dataset

## Overview

This repository contains code and documentation for selecting the best machine learning model to classify the Iris flower dataset. The Iris dataset is a popular choice for beginners in machine learning, and this project demonstrates the process of model selection and evaluation.

## Dataset

The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples of iris flowers from three different species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. Each sample includes four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The goal is to train machine learning models to classify the species of each iris flower based on these features.

## Models Explored

In this project, we explore several machine learning algorithms for classification, including but not limited to:

- Logistic Regression
- k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- **data/:** Contains the Iris dataset in CSV format.
- **notebooks/:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **src/:** Python scripts for helper functions and model training.
- **results/:** Saved models and evaluation metrics.


## Running the Models

You can run the models and evaluate their performance by following the instructions in the Jupyter notebooks. Each notebook provides detailed explanations and code for specific tasks, such as data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Results

We have provided evaluation metrics and visualizations in the notebooks to compare the performance of different models.
